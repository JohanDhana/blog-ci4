## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.

This repository holds a composer-installable app starter.
It has been built from the

## Installation & updates

`composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter` then `composer update` whenever

## Setup

Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.
